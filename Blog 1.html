            Hello, I am Jerome (or Nique, if you want to call me by that), 
            if you didn't know already from the title of this website. 
            I am a Grade 7 student, and I study at Westfield Science-Oriented School 
            while also being the eldest of five. But enough about me. Let us talk about this blog. 
          </div>

          <div class="justify">
            You may ask, "What was the reason why he created this blog?"
            Well, I did it because of three reasons, first, because it was a school project (specifically
            my English project), second, I felt that I wanted to show my HTML and CSS prowess to others, and
            third, I wanted to share my personal life, both past
            and present (with some boundaries). I needed and wanted to do this blog.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="justify">
            So I promise, from today to when I decide to shut down this website (which will be
            a long time), I will update this website with a great story, 
            every day or every other day. Have a nice day, and if you see a new blog, 
            check it out! You might find a interesting story.
