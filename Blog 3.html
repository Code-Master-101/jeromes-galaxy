            Everyone has his or her own responsibilities at home. Washing the dishes,
            fixing the bed, help your siblings in their chores or help them study, and other
            tasks and errands that one is assigned to do. Today, I will tell you what I do at
            home. From mopping the floors to fixing the bed, let's see what "mess" we get to.

            I wash the dishes at dinner. Lately, I haven't really have enough time, but before,
            I washed the dishes for everyone after they ate. There are about 9 to 10 plates, 18 to 20 utensils
            that I have to wash. Maybe it is just me, but it is really hard to wash it.
            To try not to discourage myself, I don't look how large it is to me and just wash
            with no hesitation.

          <br>
          <div class="justify">
            When I have time (since I have the earliest start time among my siblings), I fold the blankets
            and fix my bed. I also mop the floors if told to. Sometimes it feels hard
            to do your responsibilities, but at the end of the day, you should ask yourself,
            "Is it really hard, or I am just stopping myself?" Have a nice day, and as always, 
            see you next time.
