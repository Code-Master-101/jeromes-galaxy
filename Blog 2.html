            The COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic - one of the deadliest pandemics in this century, 
            with over 126 million cases, and 2.76 million deaths worldwide.
            It has separated millions of families, has left millions in the hospital fighting
            for their lives, and left people dead. So today, this blog will share how it
            affected the Earth and I.

            On March 15, 2020, the Philippines was officially under a lockdown. Over the
            following days, more and more countries were lockdown, with India having
            the largest lockdown. However, due to violations of guidelines, as well as
            slow response from international governments, more and more became infected, and
            and some even died. I just hope that people become more aware of the requirements
            of sanitation, masks, and other COVID-19 guidelines.

            It also affected my personal life. No longer did I have the freedom to go outside
            and meet up with friends. I couldn't go and visit my relatives from afar. My family
            and I stayed at home, praying that we, along with others, may be spared from the virus.
            Face-to-face classes weren't allowed anymore, which I am still missing to this day.
            In short, the pandemic changed everything about my life and force me to adapt.
            Have a nice day, and as always, see you next time (and please, wear a mask when you go out).
