            Welcome to this blog. This will be the last part of my coding series. Read 
            <a href="Blog 4.html">Part I</a> to learn more. Here, I will show what expectations
            I have for my coding "career."

            In the next year, I want to develop a game in either Unity or Java, or maybe both if
            I have the time. How will I do this? Well, I will take more time to learn more about
            how different functions, and how to link them up to create a functional (and hopefully
            good) game.

          <div class="justify">
            This will be a step forward. From there, I will use that as momentum for my other
            projects. If people view it positively, I'll try to build on the good qualities of the
            game and be motivated to make another good game. If others view it negatively,
            I'll listen to their complaints and try to improve on the areas it is struggling on,
            such as the graphics, functionality, and servers. Have a great day, and
            as always, see you next time.
