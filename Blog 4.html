            Coding is fun, albeit hard. But why do I think that coding is fun? In this blog,
            I will tell you my journey in coding. From coding HTML webpages, to coding Java 
            text RPGs, to trying to create Unity games, to coding HTML webpages again, let's 
            go deep into this amazing path of mine.

            A year ago, when lockdown hit every community, my family and I were having a hard
            time to find new activities to do. We couldn't just visit our relatives (and vice versa),
            and we couldn't go outside and play basketball, which is one of my favorite
            hobbies to do. But, with a push of a figurative button, I got interested in making
            applications and games. I thought to myself, "I like video games, so why don't I create
            some?"

            Some people suggested that I should try to code HTML before actually coding any programming
            language. So I decided to learn. I searched "HTML coding websites" and went from there.
            I learned a lot about the basics of HTML code, like creating animations, and website
            aesthetics. So then, I thought I was ready to start programming.

            I became interested in Java, mainly because it is more challenging than other languages
            but it is not too hard that I would give up immediately. I liked learning Java, as well
            as creating projects. I then learned graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that was the next
            step to creating good apps. But, I ran into a dilemma.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="justify">
            I wanted to create a game with
            graphics. But then, after I downloaded the software I knew I needed, it did not work.
            I tried again and again, but it still refused to do anything. I decided to
            troubleshoot the issue, but to no avail. I waited for days, but nothing happened.
            Finally, I decided to close the project indefinitely.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="justify">
            I searched for different ways to create games with graphics. Then, I found Unity.
            For those who don't know, Unity is a "cross-platform game engine." In more simple
            terms, it is where developers create games to be released on multiple devices, such
            as consoles, phones, and computers. I began learning about AI, as well as simple game
            designs. I kept developing new projects, until the second semester of this school
            year, after I decided to fully focus on studies.

            When my English teacher announced that we would be creating a website to host my
            new blog, I was excited to show what I could do with code. So I hopped back to
            my seat to code my new website. So, my readers, this is my coding path. There might
            be bumps along the way, but I will continue to learn. So, have a great day, and
            as always, see you next time.
